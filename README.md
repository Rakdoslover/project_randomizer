# My Randomizer

## Purpose of the site

My mission here is to create a site with the purpose to generate a small session depending which muscle group the user chooses.
The function the site revolves around is a toggle function the shows/hides the sessions, by default it's hidden.
Each session gets 5 exercises (2 compound movements and 3 more specific exercises).

## Screenshots of the process

The sites basics are getting into formation, i've decide put a a light grey background as the backdrop and I think i will implement some kind of set/rep/rest table to with the sessions.

Rewrote most of the site and switched out the dropdown menu and now it looks something like this:
