#My Randomizer

##Purpose of the site

My mission here is to create a site with the purpose to generate a small session depending which muscle group the user chooses.
The initial idea is to randomize 3 exercises (1 compound movement + 2 specific movements), this will then create the small training session for the user.
The plan is to make a lot of divs connected to a specific class which on the index.html will be invisible only shown when called upon.

##Screenshots of the process

The sites basics are getting into formation, i've decide put a a light grey background as the backdrop and I think i will implement some kind of set/rep/rest table to with the sessions.
